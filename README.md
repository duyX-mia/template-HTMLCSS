To create a full-stack web app, you'll need to use a front-end library like React and a back-end runtime like Node.js.  
React handles the client-side user interface and interactions,   
-build the UI and make HTTP requests to the Node.js server to fetch data or update the database.  
Node.js takes care of server-side logic and database operations.
