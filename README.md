To create a full-stack web app, you'll need to use a front-end library like React and a back-end runtime like Node.js.  
  
-React handles the client-side user interface and interactions,   
build the UI and make HTTP requests to the Node.js server to fetch data or update the database.  
-Node.js takes care of server-side logic and database operations.

Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) applications with optimized performance. It offers features like automatic code splitting, static site generation, and client-side rendering to improve performance.  
Additionally, it simplifies the process of building server-side rendered applications by taking care of underlying infrastructure, so you can focus on building your application logic.
